Weaknesses

As an MBA candidate, one of the areas I’ve identified for improvement is my tendency to let first impressions influence my judgment of people or situations. I’ve realized that this can sometimes lead to premature conclusions and decision when coordinating with team members. I am consistently making efforts to improve this tendency with aim to on giving others opportunity to present themselves fully and ensure my assessments are based on facts not on bias.

Another area I’ve identified for improvement is my tendency to feel nervous in stressful situations, even when I’ve completed tasks well ahead of deadlines. While I understand that this is often due to my desire for maintaining everything in order, I’ve realized that this mindset can sometimes undermine my confidence in high-pressure moments. To make this situation better, I’ve started adopting strategies like mindfulness techniques and breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable parts to maintain clarity and composure. 

I believe that without proper guidance, I still have room to grow. Pursuing an MBA offers the perfect opportunity to accelerate this growth by leveraging the program’s focus on teamwork, cultural diversity, and navigating regular high-pressure situations to develop smarter decision-making skills.
