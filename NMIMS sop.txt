My journey into marketing began during my tenure as a Business Development Intern at an ice cream company. This role offered me the unique opportunity to witness the entire product lifecycle—from ideation to launch. Being involved in conceptualizing flavors, strategizing market entry, and observing how branding shapes consumer perception ignited my passion for understanding how products evolve into successful brands.

Pursuing a degree in Business Management further fuelled this interest, deepening my understanding of brand growth and sharpening my desire to craft impactful, data-driven strategies that resonate with both consumers and businesses. I developed a keen interest in uncovering the drivers behind consumer decisions and exploring how data can be leveraged to create meaningful and memorable brand narratives. 

In subsequent roles at Mobikwik, NatWest Group and Melonleaf Consulting, I gained hands-on experience in Project Management and Partnership Engagement. I refined my skills in streamlining workflows, fostering communication, and ensuring alignment of tasks with key milestones.
